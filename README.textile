h2. Summary

"This project":http://github.com/phunt/zktop provides a unix "top" like utility for ZooKeeper.

h3. What's Apache ZooKeeper?

From the "official site":http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/: "ZooKeeper is a high-performance coordination service for distributed applications."

It exposes common services - such as naming, configuration management, synchronization, and group services - in a simple interface so you don't have to write them from scratch. You can use it off-the-shelf to implement consensus, group management, leader election, and presence protocols.
